# Simulation of Bystander Effect in Python

## Project summary

The bystander effect is a theory that says that individuals are less likely to
offer help to a victim in presence of other individuals. A number of real world
experiments conducted in controlled and green field environments using recordings
from security proved this theory to have a solid background.

Having a formula that describes the behavior of individuals makes it possible to
use simulations to predict the reaction of people in various situations. This repo
uses a modified version of a known [formula](https://www.guokr.com/article/6172/)
that accounts for two additional parameters:

- **individual probability** of **not calling** help  
- distance between an individual and an event  

The project is based on a simulation university that runs itself and does not
require a user to explicitly define the parameters of interactions between the
agents. The practical importance of this simulation is that it can be used in
city planning, legislation improvement and placement of city cameras.
